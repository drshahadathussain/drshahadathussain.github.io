            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Presently, I am focused on developing metamaterial composites using carbon and glass fibers with various polymer matrices as well as interpenetrating phase composites (IPCs). Additionally, I am advancing additive manufacturing of green steel via Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), investigating printing parameters, mechanical properties, and large-scale applications in heavy structures. My expertise spans FFF, Laser Powder Bed Fusion, Stereolithography (SLA), and PolyJet methods, utilizing Raise3D Pro3 Plus HS, Forge1, and Forge for ceramic printing, Formlabs Form 2 and 3, Stratasys F370 and J750, and EOS M400 metal printers. I am also trained in operating an industrial ABB robot arm with a Meltio wire filament printing head, featuring six laser sources for advanced 3D printing.</p>
            <p>I have gained expertise in additive manufacturing, specifically in the field of Selective Laser Melting/Laser Powder Bed Fusion, focusing on TPMS structures of NiTi. Additionally, I have experience in vacuum induction melting of copper-based shape memory alloys. Throughout my work, I have developed various transferable skills, including information management, data analysis, teamwork and collaboration, negotiation skills, creative problem solving, and project management.</p>
            <p>I have expertise in operating advanced scientific equipment, including JEOL, FEI Quanta 3D FIB, and FEI Nova NanoSEM for SEI, BSE, and EDS, as well as Bruker D2 and Rigaku MiniFlex X-ray diffractometers and Leica optical microscopes. I am skilled in thermal analysis using Mettler Toledo and Setaram DSC instruments, and in conducting tensile, compression, and fatigue tests with Instron 5969 and 8872 machines. Additionally, I have experience in hot/cold rolling, heat treatment, quenching, metallography, and etching.</p>
            <p>With a PhD in materials science and technology and a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, I possess a unique and cutting-edge skill set. My research focus on developing new copper-based shape memory alloys for high-temperature applications has resulted in the publication of research articles in highly reputable SCI journals in the field of materials science and technology.</p>
            <p>My previous experiences include working as a project fellow in a government project and serving as a lecturer, which has honed my communication, presentation, management, coordination, and leadership skills. I have also gained teaching experience during my one-year tenure.</p>
